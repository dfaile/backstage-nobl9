# Nobl9 Project Bot PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Nobl9 Project Bot is an AI-powered interface that enables unprivileged users to create and manage Nobl9 projects through an intuitive conversational interface. The bot supports both web and CLI interfaces, providing asynchronous interactions to create projects and manage role assignments without requiring pre-existing Nobl9 system access.

## Goals
1. Enable autonomous project creation and role management in Nobl9
2. Reduce the need for manual intervention in project setup
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for project management
4. Ensure secure and controlled access to Nobl9 resources
5. Support both web and CLI interfaces with consistent functionality

## User Stories
1. As a new team member, I want to create a Nobl9 project so that I can start monitoring my services
2. As a project lead, I want to assign multiple roles to team members so that they can access the project appropriately
3. As a user, I want to know if a project name is already taken so that I can choose a different name
4. As an administrator, I want to bulk assign roles to multiple users so that I can efficiently manage project access
5. As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I can fix the issue quickly

## Functional Requirements

### Project Creation
1. The system must accept project name and description as input
2. The system must validate project name uniqueness
3. The system must inform users if a project name is taken and provide the current owner's information
4. The system must create projects using the Nobl9 Go SDK
5. The system must support asynchronous project creation

### Role Management
1. The system must support assigning multiple roles to a single user
2. The system must prevent redundant role assignments
3. The system must validate user existence in Nobl9 before role assignment
4. The system must support bulk role assignments
5. The system must provide clear instructions when users don't exist in Nobl9

### Interface
1. The system must provide both web and CLI interfaces
2. The system must support asynchronous interactions
3. The system must maintain conversation context
4. The system must provide clear, actionable error messages
5. The system must support configuration through a config file

### Security & Access
1. The system must use Nobl9 access keys for authentication
2. The system must implement smart rate limiting with exponential backoff
3. The system must store sensitive configuration in a secure config file
4. The system must validate all user inputs before processing

## Non-Goals
1. Real-time project monitoring
2. Project deletion or modification
3. Role removal or modification
4. Integration with external authentication systems
5. Support for other Nobl9 features beyond project creation and role management

## Technical Considerations
1. Use the latest Nobl9 API version
2. Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
3. Store configuration in a YAML/JSON config file
4. Implement comprehensive error logging
5. Use the Nobl9 Go SDK for all Nobl9 operations

## Success Metrics
1. Number of successful project creations
2. Number of successful role assignments
3. Error rate and types
4. User satisfaction with error messages
5. Time saved in project setup

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement a retry mechanism for failed role assignments?
2. How should we handle partial successes in bulk operations?
3. What should be the default rate limiting parameters?
4. Should we implement a feedback mechanism for error messages?

## Configuration Requirements
The system will require a configuration file (`config.yaml`) with the following structure:
```yaml
nobl9:
  api_key: "your-api-key"
  organization: "your-org"
  base_url: "https://app.nobl9.com"

rate_limits:
  initial_delay: 1000  # milliseconds
  max_delay: 30000    # milliseconds
  max_retries: 3
